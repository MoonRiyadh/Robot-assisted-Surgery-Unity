# Role of stress in Human-Robot interaction: robotic assisted surgery

Measure cognitive workload in interaction inside a simulated surgical scenario. 
The goal of the project is the conceptual design and implementation of an intent
recognition platform which improves human-robot interaction even under stressful circumstances.


## Code of conduct

This project runs under Cognitive Assistance Systems (COS), DFKI, Saarbrucken.  

# Modalities

EEG, eye-tracking, and ECG

# Tools

- Unity 3D

- Varjo Aero VR HMD with eye tracking 

- Enobio 20 EEG System

- Shimmer ECG

- OptiTrack

- iMotion


# My responsibilities and contribution to this project

- Software/Prototype development (Unity3D, VR)

- Signal Processing (EEG, ECG, eye-tracking)

- Research and Development

**Scenario:** 
_Suppose a user (the doctor in our case) in a virtual operation room that simulates a real world operation room in a hospital.
He is performing a basic (depending on user study design) task such as stretching or performing small surgery. We want to measure 
his cognitive workload based on the intense task. We will collect EEG, ECG, eye-tracking data for this scenario._

I am working as a **Research Assistant** on this project. I am responsible for research and development of this project based on the above scenario. This will include software development, prototyping and conduct user studies. I am implementing a Virtual Hospital room where doctors can perform given tasks. I am developing natural input modalities for this project such as holding medical instruments in natural way. For this reason, we use external tracking systems to track objects in realtime. At the same time, the objects (scalpels, scissors) should be realistic. I write custom scripts/API to integrate Unity and OptiTrack. I am also responsible for signal processing, feature extraction and data analysis.
